# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This web application was developed to centralise the outcomes of my learnings from the prework issued by the Sydney Uni EdX bootcamp. Other applications could be used however, they cannot be as easily tailored as a fully customisable web application.

This now provides a space for me to refer to during the course to build on my basic foundations that were built during the prework stage.

## Installation

## Usage

This webpage is used to refer to during the bootcamp as it has notes on the basics of CSS, HTML, JS, GIT, and Terminal Prompts.

If using Chrome Dev, the user can inspect the webpage to view what the JS is doing in the background. The console will list the contents of the webpage which are the fundamental learnings from the prework and the console can also provide a suggestion of what program to learn first.
